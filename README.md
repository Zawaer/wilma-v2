## Wilma V2

A better Wilma client

This is a modern user interface for the school site [Wilma](https://espoo.inschool.fi/). I built this because I was frustrated by the old and nonfunctional UI of Wilma. My project aims to do the same necessary stuff as Wilma while looking and functioning way better. This website uses Next.js and Tailwind CSS.
